The dataset used in this project is a widely recognized dataset from Kaggle, which has been extensively explored through explanatory data analysis. In this analysis, we aim to apply supervised machine learning algorithms like random forest and boosting to the dataset. To establish comparisons, we also include logistics regression and decision tree as the two baseline methods. 

The performance of the models will be evaluated based on the testing error on an independent testing dataset. To fine-tune the models and optimize their performance, we will employ cross-validation techniques to identify the optimal values for the tuning parameters. Additionally, variable selection will be performed using a stepwise Bayesian information criterion (BIC) approach for the logistics regression method.

By comparing the performance of the random forest and boosting with the baseline models, we can assess their effectiveness in accurately predicting the target variable. The findings from this analysis will shed light on the most suitable model for this dataset and provide insights into the optimal tuning parameters and relevant variables that contribute to the model's performance.
